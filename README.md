# Quickey
A web app to display common shortcuts for a keyboard-only dev experience.

In a creative profession, the ability to design nice things is heavily connected with the proper use of the mouse. For developers, that is different.
Every trip to the mouse means less code that could have been written in the same amount of time.

This website helps new developers speed up their game by being able to ditch the mouse as much as possible.
